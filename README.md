# x86-64 Limine Kernel Template
This is my version of the Limine-based kernel. It's basically
just a stripped down version of the [Limine C Template](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine-c-template/),
keeping only the x86-64 architecture support & restructuring the code(no more `kernel/` directory).
